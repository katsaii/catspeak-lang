However, depending on the game, the modding API its developers reveal to modders
could vary wildly. Because of this, you should contact the developers of the
game and make sure they compile a list of which functions are exposed by their
API, if they haven't already. Catspeak is not responsible for this.</p><p>The likelyhood that the modding API will include built-in GameMaker functions
is high, so you should familiarise yourself with the documentation for the
<a href="https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FGML_Reference.htm">GameMaker standard library</a>.</p><p>Catspeak comes packaged with a custom programming language which resembles
JavaScript and GameMaker Language. It's likely that most games adding mod
support through Catspeak will use this pre-packaged language. However, if the
game you are creating a mod for uses a different language, then you need to ask
the developers of that game for information about the language they are using
for modding.</p><section><h1 class="heading" id="dealing-with-errors"><a href="#dealing-with-errors">ยง</a> <strong>Dealing with Errors</strong><a href="#" class="heading-top">top ^</a></h1><p>Chances are your mod will fail or misbehave eventually. Whether or not this is
a fatal error (the game crashes) or a silent error (the game unloads your mod)
is up to the developers of the game to decide. If you suspect that your mod is
failing for whatever reason, you should:</p><ul><li><p>Figure out how the developers are handling mod errors so you can get a an
error trace. This will help tell you the line and column the error occurred
on.</p></li><li><p>Check that your code does not have any typos, which can be a common error.</p></li><li><p>Check that the syntax for your code is correct by familiarising yourself with
the modding language. <em>Documentation for the built-in Catspeak programming
language can be found in the <a href="./lan-overview.html">Language Reference</a> book.</em>
When in doubt, do not make assumptions about syntax; look it up.</p></li><li><p>Ask the developers for more debugging tools, like exposing GameMakers
<code class="inline-code">show_debug_message</code> function.</p></li><li><p>Cry in a corner against all odds.</p></li></ul></section></article></main></article><footer><hr><article><em id="brand">Built using Catlog, the <a href="https://www.katsaii.com/catspeak-lang/">Catspeak</a> book generator.</em></article><article></article></footer></body></html>
