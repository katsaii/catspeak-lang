# Installation

1) Get a recent release of Catspeak from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/katsaii/catspeak-lang/releases).
    You should see a download for a file with the extension `.yymps`.

 2) Open your project file in the GameMaker IDE.

 3) Navigate to the toolbar at the top of the IDE and find "Tools". Click this
    and select "Import Local Package" from the drop-down menu.

 4) Select the `.yymps` file you downloaded, and follow the wizard to import
    the Catspeak resources. If you're not sure what to import, click "Add All".

Now you're setup, see the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) section for an
introductory example, or read through the [Catspeak for Developers](./hom-catspeak-for-developers.html)
chapter for a full-fat overview.

# Basic Usage

A minimal working example of a function which returns a message:

```gml
// parse Catspeak code
var hir = Catspeak.parseString(@'
  let catspeak = "Catspeak"

  return "hello! from within " + catspeak
');

// compile Catspeak code into a callable GML function
var getMessage = Catspeak.compile(hir);

// call the Catspeak code just like you would any other GML function!
show_message(getMessage());
```

Create an object, then copy-and-paste this code into its create event to see
magic happen.
