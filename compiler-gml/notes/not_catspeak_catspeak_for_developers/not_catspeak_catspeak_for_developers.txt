Catspeak is the spiritual successor to the old GML function `execute_string`.
This means that custom user code can be executed as a string by your game
for modding support or a debug console. In nerdspeak: Catspeak is a compiler
backend and virtual machine for executing arbitrary code at runtime.

Unlike `execute_string`, Catspeak is slightly more involved, requiring three
separate steps:

 - [Parsing](#parsing)
 - [Compiling](#compiling)
 - [Executing](#executing)

In order for your modders to access information about your game, you need to
manually expose a modding API (covered briefly in the [Interfacing with GML](#interfacing-with-gml)
section). _Catspeak does not do this for you by default._ Further information
about different methods to expose functions can be found in the [Library Reference](./lib-struct-catspeakforeigninte+s.html)
book.

If this busywork does not sound interesting to you, and you're the kind of
developer who likes to cut corners, then you can [throw caution to the wind](./lib-struct-catspeakforeigninte+s.html#exposeeverythingidontcareifmod+s)
and include the following code in your project:

```meow
Catspeak.interface.exposeEverythingIDontCareIfModdersCanEditUsersSaveFilesJustLetMeDoThis = true;
```

This will force Catspeak lift the veil safety and attempt to give modders access
every intimate detail about your game. Don't say I didn't warn you.

# Parsing

Parsing is the first step. This involves taking the human-readable form of
Catspeak source code, and converting it into an executable form. This can
be done from a string or a UTF-8 encoded buffer.

Parsing code from a string using `Catspeak.parseString`:
```gml
var hir = Catspeak.parseString(@'
  let n = 0
  while n <= 10 {
    n += 1
  }
  return "blast off!"
');
```

Parsing code from a file called "my_mod.meow", using `Catspeak.parse`:
```gml
var file = buffer_load("my_mod.meow");

var hir = Catspeak.parse(file);

buffer_delete(file);
```

The parser produces a **hierarchical intermediate-representation** (HIR),
storing information like what functions are defined, where they are defined,
how many variables are used, what functions are being called and when, etc.

This information is stored as a JSON object, so you can cache this to a file
to avoid parsing large mods every time the game loads.

# Compiling

Compiling is the second step. This involves taking the executable form of a
Catspeak program (the HIR obtained from [Parsing](#parsing)) and transforms it
into a callable GML function.

Compiling a `program` from the `hir` using `Catspeak.compile`:
```gml
var program = Catspeak.compile(hir);
```

# Executing

Executing is the third and final step; this is the fun part. After compiling
a program, it can be called like any ordinary GML function like:
```gml
program();
```

As many times as you want:
```gml
program();
program();
program();
repeat (10) {
    program();
}
```

When adding mod support, you should aim to pre-compile all of your mod scripts
at the start of the game, and then reuse the compiled program during gameplay.
Otherwise, your game may experience performance issues due to the slowness of
parsing and compiling programs relative to execution.

# Interfacing with GML

You can expose additional functions, constants, and assets to Catspeak programs
by using the methods on `Catspeak.interface`. For example, using the functions
`exposeFunction`, `exposeConstant`, and `exposeAsset` to make `show_message`,
`pi`, and `spr_player` available from within a Catspeak function:

```gml
Catspeak.interface.exposeFunction("show_message", show_message);
Catspeak.interface.exposeConstant("math_pi", pi);
Catspeak.interface.exposeAsset("sPlayer", spr_player);
```

Then using these from within a custom Catspeak function, like:
```gml
var hir = Catspeak.parseString(@'
  let tau = math_pi * 2;
  show_message([sPlayer, tau]);
');
var program = Catspeak.compile(hir);
program();
```

This is necessary so that modders are sandboxed from each other, and don't have
unchecked access to your entire game state. There are many other ways of
exposing GML assets to Catspeak programs, see [CatspeakForeignInterface](lib-struct-catspeakforeigninte+s.html)
