📝 **Minimal Setup Required**

 - Self-contained and ready to use after installation.
 - No need to place a persistent God Object in the first room of your game!

☯ **Seamless GML-Catspeak Interoperability**

 - Call GML code from Catspeak.
 - Call Catspeak code from GML.
 - Familiar syntax inspired by GML and JavaScript.

🏃‍♀️ **Performant Runtime**

 - Optimising compiler generates performant code capable of competing with pure GML implementations.
 - At best, Catspeak code will be just as fast as GML.
 - On average, Catspeak code will be 5x slower than GML.

👽 **Cross-platform**

 - Implemented in pure GML.
 - No external dependencies or platform-specific DLLs.
 - Mods should work on any target platform. _(Tested on Windows 10 using: VM, YYC, HTML5, and GMRT)_

🔨 **Customisable, Sandboxed Runtime Environment**

 - Modders cannot gain access to parts of your game you don't want them to.
 - Expose only the functions and resources you feel comfortable with.
 - Impossible for modders to execute malicious code by default.
 - Detects infinite loops and recursion so the sly `while true { }` doesn't freeze your game, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

💪 **Built for Power Users**

 - Full compiler back-end documented and available for experimentation.
 - Pre-compile your scripts to JSON, and cache them for later. Skip straight to code generation.
 - Parse your own domain-specific language into Catspeak IR, then let the code generator turn that into a GML compatibile representation:
   - A custom UI language which supports running user-defined functions as button events.
   - A custom data-specification language where certain keywords act as calls to GML functions.
   - A simple shell-script language for a developer console.
   - A custom scripting language for a programming game.

🙀 **Cute Name and Mascot**
